      This is a simple slide puzzle game created using Unity3D. A joint project between myself
      and <%= mail_to "CALiforykng5i5@gmail.com", "Ying Kit Ng" %>, the game was intended to be
      an application suitable for social media sites like Facebook. The goal of the game is to
      rearrange the tiles into the proper order, only moving one tile at a time. The game tracked
      the number of moves and the elapsed time, and our intent was for the player to be able to
      share his scores with others.

      I was responsible for implementing the client portion of the game, which would handle all
      of the actual game logic, while Ying Kit would implement the server portion. The client is
      mostly finished, with only the actual implementation of server API calls remaining. For
      demo purposes, I've exported the client &mdash; originally intended to run on the Unity Web
      Player &mdash; as standalone executables.

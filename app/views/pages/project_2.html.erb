    <li>I chose to use bootstrap-sass for this project</li>
    <li>After adding 'gem "bootstrap-sass"' to the project Gemfile, I ran "bundle install" to import the gem.</li>
    <li>After that, it was a simple matter of playing around with the CSS and HTML files.</li>
    <li>The result, crude as it is, is rather obvious.</li>
